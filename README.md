Cryptotrack is designed to be a very tiny ANSI C program which, as its name states, allows the tracking of cryptocurrency prices.
One of the main goals of this project is to require as few external dependencies as possible, the only one as of now being libcurl.

# Usage:

-f - List a range of comma-separated cryptocurrencies.
